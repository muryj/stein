Reflecting and exploring what the ways of exporting grain from Ukraine to the world looked like, and especially now that people are forced to harvest some grain right in the middle of burning fields due to the full-scale invasion, I created a canvas completely filled with coal with a narrow white stripe. During my performance, I first methodically filled the entire canvas with charcoal and then used bread as an eraser. In this way, I was rethinking the role and application of bread. After I used the bread as an eraser, I collected all the leftover bread in a glass box and securely fixed it. This sculpture made of a glass box and bread represents the illusion of availability. In fact, there is enough food in the world for hunger to never exist again, but as soon as bread (food) is misused for other purposes, such as influence, genocide, politics, we have an artificially created famine.',

It provided for the theft of collective farm property (and even a few ears of grain that had overwintered under the snow in the field were considered as such), and for the execution on the spot and confiscation of property. In the presence of mitigating circumstances, the punishment was 10 years in camps. Amnesty was prohibited. And this is despite the fact that under the legislation of the time, even premeditated murder was punishable by up to 10 years in prison. And theft of other people\'s property was punishable by up to three months of forced labour.\n' +

Ukrainians found themselves in a deadly trap: fantastic plans for grain distribution (or, more simply, plans for grain confiscation) condemned peasants to starvation. Any attempts to escape and hide food threatened with confiscation of all edible items (for failure to comply with the grain delivery) or execution.\n' +

In Ukraine, a huge part of the cultural heritage is associated with agriculture, with the production of bread, with the process of harvesting. There are many paintings in 20th-century Ukrainian painting depicting everyday scenes of harvesting or resting afterwards. The paintings always depict the classic golden fields of Ukraine. People are an integral part of this process, just as they are an integral part of the landscape.  I hadn\'t paid that much attention to it before, but after the full-scale invasion, the question of how a person practically, their body directly becomes part of the poisoned landscape really came to light. Thinking about this, I created paintings where people are in classic post-harvest resting poses, like from classic 20th century paintings, as if lying on wheat fields, but now the person just merges with the background. This raises the question of what is the main thing in the composition, the person or the background, the person or the landscape, at the same time as the question of what is the main thing, human life or the bread that a person grows.',
